# The-Oregon-Trail

I created this game because I was inspired how "The Oregon Trail" game was made. You only have so many supplies with you and it was extremely difficult. Although, it was challenging, that doesn't mean it wasn't fun.

In this version, I added different variations to the game. I added a fatigue level, which increases everything you continue down the trail. You don't want it too high or else you will get sick, and may die if you let it too high. When you get sick, you can stop to rest and eventually heal you. I also added profession perks. For example, when choosing banker, you get discounts from nearby travelers.

I ran into some challenges while making this, and if you have any suggestions or errors that you run into while running this game, let me know.

To install and run the project, all you have to do is download the file "The Oregon Trail.py" and run it by double clicking on the file or use python3 command in terminal.

**This project requires the modules os and random. You will need python 3.8.3 or higher**
